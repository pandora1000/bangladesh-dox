\section{Picking three stories}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bloody Chamber - DOES NOT SUPPORT
    \item Snow Child - SUPPORTS
    \item The Lady of The House of Love - SUPPORTS
\end{itemize}

\section{Look back for evidence}
\textbf{SNOW CHILD}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Shining boots with scarlet heels and}
\item{I wish I had a girl as red as blood}
\item{White skin, red mouth, black hair}
\item{He thrust his virile member into the dead girl}
\item{She was the child of his desire and the countess hated her}
\item{The Count picked up the rose, bowed and handed it to his wife; when she touched it, she dropped it.}
\end{itemize}
\textbf{BLOODY CHAMBER}
\begin{itemize}
\item{away from the white, enclosed quietude of my mother's apartment, into the unguessable country of marriage}
\item{when he put the gold band on my finger, I had, in some way, ceased to be her child in becoming his wife}
\item{My satin nightdress... teasingly caressed me, egregious, insinuating, nudging between my thighs}
\item{I was only a little girl, I did not understand}
\end{itemize}

\section{STRAWMAN ARGUMENT}

Firstly, I will present the Bloody Chamber as a literary piece which uses hyper male sexual violence to depict
the real world struggles millions of women around the world suffer.

Secondly, I will build up a counter argument, suggesting that the book is littered with unnecessary sexual violence
most notably in the Snow Child.

Thirdly, I will argue that although the Bloody Chamber may have contributed positively to the feminist movement in recent
times stories such as the Lady in the House of Love do not benefit the movement in the past and present at all.

\section{Bloody Chamber}
To an overwhelming extent it can be argued, that Carter's most famous work from the Bloody Chamber, the Blood Chamber itself, dismantles all interpretations that it had been damaging to her feminist cause. The Bloody Chamber revolves around a young inexperienced girl who is married to the much older Marquise...
\section{The Snow Child}
However, a more convincing rebuttal is that the Bloody Chamber although comprising texts that highlight genuine social issues women face, is also littered with necrophilia and unnecessary violence that damages the feminist cause. The Snow Child is about a count who manifests the perfect 'child' into existence and sexually abuses her fallen body.

\section{The Lady of The House of Love}
Moreover, the evidence is stronger to suggest that her works are damaging, seen most strongly
in LOTOL... A story, involving a woman of power coveting a young soldiers virginity...

\section{Conclusion}
In conclusion... Although now celeberated as elegant prose by many contemporary scholars and critics,
it is undeniable that the text is at many points filled with violence to the extreme - in which very little evidence can suggest that this has supported her cause. As indicated by the stories... which are still inherently patriarchal as evidenced by the Snow Child... there is no moral victory for women the Count rides on with his wife, after raping a dead body...
